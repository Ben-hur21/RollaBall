Roll-a-Ball
Welcome to my Roll-a-Ball project! This is a fun and simple game developed in Unity. You control a ball that rolls around the level, collecting objects. I created this project as part of my learning experience with Unity and game development fundamentals.
Features
Player Movement: Control the ball using keyboard input to move in all directions.
Collectibles: Pick up items scattered across the scene to increase your score.
Win Condition: You win the game by collecting all the items in the level.
User Interface: A basic UI that tracks your score in real-time.
Physics-based Movement: Leveraging Unity’s physics engine for realistic ball rolling.
How to Play
Use the arrow keys or WASD to move the ball.
Roll over the collectibles to pick them up.
Once you’ve collected everything, you win!
Getting Started
If you want to run the game on your local machine, follow these steps:
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rollaball.git
Open the project in Unity (I developed this using Unity version 202X.X.X, so using a similar or newer version is recommended).
Hit the Play button in the Unity Editor to start rolling!
Project Background
I developed this project while learning Unity and C#. Roll-a-Ball was a great way to practice core concepts like game physics, player controls, and UI design. It’s also a classic beginner project that really helps to understand how Unity handles object movement and interaction.
What’s Next?
Adding new levels with more complex layouts.
Introducing obstacles and challenges to make the gameplay more engaging.
Polishing the visuals and adding sound effects.
Exploring multiplayer features for more interactive fun.
Why Roll-a-Ball?
As a college student, I always seek ways to challenge myself and build my development portfolio. This project helped me apply what I’ve learned in class and gave me hands-on experience with the Unity game engine.
