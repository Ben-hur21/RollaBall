# Roll-a-Ball

Welcome to my **Roll-a-Ball** project! This is a fun and simple game developed in Unity. You control a ball that rolls around the level, collecting objects. I created this project as part of my learning experience with Unity and game development fundamentals.

## Features

- **Player Movement**: Control the ball using keyboard input to move in all directions.
- **Collectibles**: Pick up items scattered across the scene to increase your score.
- **Win Condition**: You win the game by collecting all the items in the level.
- **User Interface**: A basic UI that tracks your score in real-time.
- **Physics-Based Movement**: Leveraging Unity’s physics engine for realistic ball rolling.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys or `WASD` to move the ball.
2. Roll over the collectibles to pick them up.
3. Once you’ve collected everything, you win!

## Getting Started

To run the game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rollaball.git
    ```

2. Open the project in Unity (tested with Unity version 202X.X.X or newer).

3. Hit the `Play` button in the Unity Editor to start rolling!

## Project Background

I developed this project while learning Unity and C#. **Roll-a-Ball** was a great way to practice core concepts like game physics, player controls, and UI design. It’s a classic beginner project that helped me understand how Unity handles object movement and interaction.

## What’s Next?

- Adding new levels with more complex layouts.
- Introducing obstacles and challenges to make gameplay more engaging.
- Polishing visuals and adding sound effects.
- Exploring multiplayer features for more interactive fun.

## Why Roll-a-Ball?

As a college student, I always seek ways to challenge myself and build my development portfolio. This project allowed me to apply what I’ve learned in class and gave me hands-on experience with the Unity game engine.
